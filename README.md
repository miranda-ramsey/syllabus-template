# Syllabus Template

Use this template to create a PreText syllabus. Make the following changes:

## source/frontmatter.ptx

In frontmatter.ptx change the author information to reflect your information. You may adjust the year and license information too.

## source/main.ptx

In main.ptx, change the subtitle on line 9 to reflect the course name for your course. Here you may also rearrange and add sections. 

## source/sec-attendance.ptx

In attendance.ptx, add your expectations for student attendance and participation. This includes first week activities. You can wrap a list item with
`<li>
<p>
list item text here
</p>
<li>`
and delete each instance you do not need.

## source/sec-calendar.ptx

Here you can explain your weekly structure and fill your calendar. The calendar has a specific structure already created that you can use,
you simply need to make a copy of the commented out "row" element for each week you need.

## source/sec-course-information.ptx
## source/sec-grading.ptx
## source/sec-instructor.ptx
## source/sec-materials.ptx

These all need course specific information put in, using lists and tables.


## source/sec-policies.ptx

You don't need to change anything here, except perhaps your AI statement, which I wrote.
