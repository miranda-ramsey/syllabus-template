		<title>Accomodations and Services</title>
		<p>
            PCC is committed to supporting all students. If you plan to use academic accommodations 
            for this course, please contact your instructor as soon as possible to discuss your needs. 
            Accommodations are not retroactive; they begin when the instructor receives the “Approved 
            Academic Accommodations” letter from you (submitted in person for courses on campus; via 
            email for Online Learning courses). To request academic accommodations for a disability, 
            please contact an Accessible Education and Disability Resources counselor on any PCC campus. 
            Office locations, phone numbers, and additional information may be located on the 
            <url href="https://www.pcc.edu/disability/">Accessible Education and Disability Resources website</url>.

        <title>Student Rights and Responsibilities</title>
		<p>
            Students are required to complete this course in accordance with the 
            <url href="https://www.pcc.edu/policy/student-rights/">Student Rights and Responsibilities Handbook</url>. 
            The Handbook establishes students' freedoms and protections as well as expectations of 
            appropriate behavior and ethical academic work. The Handbook includes items such as the 
            Policy on Student Rights, and the Student Code of Conduct Policy and Procedures.

		<title>Academic Integrity</title>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Rules about cheating, plagiarism, or sharing work</title>
            <p>
                The handbook contains the Code of Student Conduct and the Academic Integrity Policy. 
                Cheating includes any attempt to defraud, deceive, or mislead the instructor in 
                arriving at an honest grade assessment, and may include copying answers from other 
                students or using unauthorized notes during tests. Plagiarism is a particular form 
                of cheating that involves presenting as one's own the ideas or work of another and 
                may include using other people's ideas without proper attribution and submitting 
                another person's work as one's own. Dishonest activities such as cheating on exams 
                and submitting or copying work done by others will result in disciplinary actions 
                including but not limited to receiving a failing grade. For further information, 
                review the institution's 
                <url href="https://www.pcc.edu/student-conduct/conduct/academic-integrity-at-pcc/">Academic Integrity Policy</url>.
            </p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Generative AI</title>
            <p>
                The use of generative AI tools, including but not limited to ChatGPT, to complete
                your work is strictly prohibited and will be considered equivalent to unauthorized
                sharing of work or plagiarism. <em>All AI use is strongly discouraged, even as a 
                study tool.</em> I want to help you build a strong internal understanding of the
                material without relying on outside tools. If you have a question or need help, 
                please reach out to me instead. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In return, <em>I promise that I will not use generative AI in my relationship with
                you as your instructor.</em> Any feedback you receive on your work will be my
                authentic human response to you.

            our regular due dates will be adjusted accordingly. Please check your email for my 
            instructions and continue to check D2L Brightspace during closures.
